    <h1>Python for NGS Analysis and Bioinformatics</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my Python repository! This repository is dedicated to my journey in learning Python, specifically to apply it in <strong>Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis</strong> and <strong>bioinformatics</strong>. Here, you'll find various exercises, practice questions, and code snippets that I am working on to build my skills in these areas.</p>

<h2>Repository Structure</h2>
<p>The repository is organized based on different sources from which I am learning. Each file is named according to the source and the exercise or topic it covers, following this convention:</p>
<pre><code>sourcename-exercisename.py</code></pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>datacamp-basic_loops.py</code></li>
    <li><code>codecademy-string_manipulation.py</code></li>
    <li><code>bookname-chapter2_exercises.py</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>This repository includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Basic Python Programming:</strong> Exercises and code to get familiar with Python syntax, data structures, and basic programming concepts.</li>
    <li><strong>Bioinformatics-Specific Scripts:</strong> Practice questions and solutions focused on applying Python to bioinformatics tasks, such as sequence analysis, data parsing, and more.</li>
    <li><strong>NGS Analysis:</strong> Code related to the analysis of NGS data, including data preprocessing, quality control, and sequence alignment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Use This Repository</h2>
<p>Feel free to explore the files and use the code as a reference for your own learning. Each file is well-commented to explain what the code does and how it relates to bioinformatics or NGS analysis.</p>

<h2>Future Plans</h2>
<p>As I progress in my learning, I plan to add more advanced scripts and potentially start working on small projects related to bioinformatics and NGS.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>This repository is primarily for personal learning, but if you have suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.</p>
