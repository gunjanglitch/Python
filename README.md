    <h1>Python</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my Python repository! This repository is dedicated to my journey in learning Python, specifically to apply it in <strong>Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis</strong> and <strong>bioinformatics</strong>. Here, you'll find various exercises, practice questions, and code snippets that I am working on to build my skills in these areas.</p>

<h2>Repository Structure</h2>
<p>The repository is organized based on different sources from which I am learning. Each file is named according to the source and the exercise or topic it covers, following this convention:</p>
<pre><code>sourcename-exercisename.py</code></pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>datacamp-basic_loops.py</code></li>
    <li><code>codecademy-string_manipulation.py</code></li>
    <li><code>bookname-chapter2_exercises.py</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>This repository includes Python code and scripts for:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Basic Python Programming:</strong> Exercises and practice scripts to build a strong foundation in Python syntax, data structures, loops, functions, and other core programming concepts.</li>
    <li><strong>Bioinformatics with Python:</strong> Python scripts tailored to bioinformatics tasks, such as parsing and analyzing biological sequences, performing statistical analysis, and working with bioinformatics libraries like Biopython.</li>
    <li><strong>NGS Data Analysis in Python:</strong> Python code for processing and analyzing Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data, including tasks like data preprocessing, quality control, sequence alignment, and variant calling.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Use This Repository</h2>
<p>Feel free to explore the Python scripts and use them as a learning resource. Each file is well-commented to help you understand the code and its application to bioinformatics and NGS analysis. The examples provided can be adapted and expanded for your own projects.</p>

<h2>Future Plans</h2>
<p>As I continue to learn, I plan to add more advanced Python scripts and projects, focusing on bioinformatics and NGS analysis. This may include implementing algorithms, developing custom tools, or contributing to open-source bioinformatics projects.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>This repository is primarily for personal learning, but if you have suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.</p>
